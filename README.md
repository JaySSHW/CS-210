CS 210 Portfolio Project Reflection
Project Summary and Problem Solved

For my CS 210 portfolio submission, I selected my Grocery Tracker program written in C++. This project was designed to read purchase data from an input file, track how frequently each grocery item appeared, and present that information in multiple formats. The program allows users to search for individual items, view a full list of items with purchase counts, and display a visual histogram. This project solves the problem of efficiently organizing, analyzing, and presenting structured data in a way that is both user-friendly and scalable.

What I Did Particularly Well

One area I performed particularly well was program structure and organization. I used a class-based design to separate responsibilities, which made the code easier to understand and maintain. I also implemented clear menu-driven user interaction with input validation to prevent crashes and unintended behavior. Additionally, I focused heavily on readability, using meaningful variable names, consistent formatting, and inline comments to make the code easy to follow.

Areas for Enhancement and Future Improvements

While the program meets all functional requirements, there are areas where it could be enhanced. For example, I could improve efficiency by adding better error handling for malformed input files and optimizing file I/O operations. Security and robustness could also be improved by adding stricter validation for user input and implementing exception handling. These improvements would make the application more resilient and production-ready.

Most Challenging Aspects and How I Overcame Them

The most challenging part of this project was working with file input/output and data storage using maps. Ensuring that data was read correctly, stored efficiently, and displayed accurately required careful testing and debugging. I overcame these challenges by breaking the problem into smaller steps, testing frequently, and referencing C++ documentation and course resources. This experience reinforced the value of debugging tools, documentation, and iterative development, which I will continue to rely on in future projects.

Transferable Skills Gained

This project strengthened several skills that are highly transferable to other coursework and real-world development, including:

Object-oriented programming in C++

File input/output processing

Data organization using standard library containers

Writing clean, readable, and well-documented code

Designing user-friendly, menu-driven applications

These skills will directly apply to future programming courses, larger software projects, and professional development work.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability

I made this program maintainable and adaptable by using a modular design with clearly defined class responsibilities. Consistent formatting, descriptive naming conventions, and thorough comments help ensure that the code can be easily understood by others—or by myself in the future. This structure allows for new features, such as additional data analysis or output formats, to be added with minimal changes to existing code.
